## What is a WBS chart?
 
A WBS chart is a graphical representation of a project that breaks it down into smaller and more manageable components. Each component is assigned a unique identifier, a name, a duration, a start and finish date, a cost, a work effort, and other attributes. A WBS chart can also show the dependencies and relationships between the components, as well as the resources assigned to them.
 
A WBS chart can help you to:
 
- Define the scope and objectives of your project
- Organize and prioritize your tasks and activities
- Estimate the time, cost and resources required for your project
- Track the progress and status of your project
- Identify and manage risks and issues
- Communicate your project plan to stakeholders
